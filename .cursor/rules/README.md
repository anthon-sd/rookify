# Cursor Rules Organization

This directory contains the organized rules for the Rookify Chess Coaching Platform, structured for better maintainability and clarity.

## File Structure

- **`main.md`** - Project overview, architecture summary, and core principles
- **`coding-standards.md`** - Language-specific coding standards and quality guidelines
- **`architecture.md`** - System architecture, integrations, and performance considerations
- **`database.md`** - Database schema design and query best practices
- **`patterns.md`** - Common patterns for APIs, frontend components, and error handling
- **`development.md`** - Development workflow, Docker setup, and environment management
- **`security.md`** - Security guidelines and best practices

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Modular**: Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the project
- **Maintainable**: Easier to update specific sections without affecting others
- **Discoverable**: Clear file names make it easy to find relevant guidelines
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new rule categories as the project grows

## Migration

This structure replaces the single `.cursorrules` file with a more organized approach. All original content has been preserved and categorized appropriately.
