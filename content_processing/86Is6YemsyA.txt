transcript = "in chess every piece has a point value and in this video i'm going to explain what those point values are and how you should be using them when you play a game the king is infinite value because if you lose your king or get checkmated the game is just over the queen is worth nine points the rook is worth five points the bishop and the knight are both worth three points and the pawn is worth one point and you can use this information when you're playing a game to determine if you should make a trade or not you can tell if it's a good trade or a bad trade based on how many points you're going to give up and how many points you're going to get so now let's look at some examples of what this looks like when you're playing an actual game first example is this position very common position happens all the time and the question is should you give up your knight for this pawn right here keep in mind that his nike can recapture well the answer is no because you're going to get one pawn one point when you take the pawn and you're going to lose when he captures you back three points so you're it's a net loss of two points so it does not make sense to capture that pawn the next example is should you capture this knight with your bishop the answer is you can that's fine it's just an even trade so you're giving up three points and you're getting three points so it's it balances out so if you want to that's okay to do all right the last example i want to show you is this position and the question is should you capture this knight with your rook yes or no the answer is yes you should and the reason is when you first capture the knight you gain three points when he recaptures your rook you lose five points but then when this rook captures the night you gain three more points so at the end of the day you gain six points and you lose five points you gain one point so you should make that trade so throughout the game this is the thought process that you should be going through when you're thinking about taking a piece or making a trade you have to ask yourself how many points are you going to lose and how many points you're going to get and if you get more than you lose you should do it and if not you shouldn't thanks for watching the video i hope you learned something about the value of the chess pieces i have one final puzzle that i want to leave you with and the question is simply this should white or should they not move their knight from f3 to d4 and capture black's knight go ahead and put something in the comments below let me know what you think if white should do that or if they should not thanks a lot."
