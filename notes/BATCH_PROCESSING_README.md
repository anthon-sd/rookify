# Chess Analysis Batch Processing & Selective Criteria

This document describes the enhanced AI engine with batch processing capabilities and selective LLM criteria for dramatically improved performance.

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- **Sequential processing**: 1 position at a time
- **Time per position**: 2-4 seconds (Stockfish + OpenAI)
- **100-move game**: 200-400 seconds (3-7 minutes)
- **OpenAI usage**: 100% of positions analyzed

### After Optimization:
- **Batch processing**: Up to 50 positions at once
- **Parallel Stockfish**: 4x speedup with engine pool
- **Selective LLM**: 80-90% reduction in OpenAI calls
- **Time per game**: 20-40 seconds (10x improvement)
- **Cost reduction**: 80-90% lower OpenAI API costs

## 🎯 Selective LLM Criteria

The system now intelligently decides when to call OpenAI based on:

### Always Analyze (High Value Positions):
- **Brilliant** moves - Exceptional plays worth learning from
- **Great** moves - Above-average plays with teaching value
- **Blunder** moves - Critical errors requiring immediate attention

### Sometimes Analyze (Based on User Level):
- **Mistakes** - Limited per game based on user rating
- **Tactical positions** - Checks, captures, threats
- **Phase transitions** - Opening→Middlegame→Endgame
- **Critical eval swings** - Large position changes (>200cp)
- **Endgame positions** - Few pieces remaining
- **Mate-in-X** positions - Forced sequences

### User Rating Thresholds:

#### Beginners (< 1200):
- Focus on major mistakes and brilliant plays
- Maximum 3 mistakes analyzed per game
- Delta CP threshold: 100+ centipawns
- Prioritize fundamental concepts

#### Intermediate (1200-1800):
- Include smaller mistakes and good moves
- Maximum 5 mistakes analyzed per game
- Delta CP threshold: 50+ centipawns
- Balance tactics and strategy

#### Advanced (1800+):
- Analyze subtle inaccuracies too
- Maximum 7 mistakes analyzed per game
- Delta CP threshold: 30+ centipawns
- Focus on fine-tuned evaluation

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Stockfish Pool Management
- Pool of 4 Stockfish instances (configurable)
- Parallel position analysis
- Automatic pool management and cleanup

### Batch Processing Flow
1. **Validation** - Check batch size (max 100) and required fields
2. **Optimization** - Sort positions for better caching
3. **Parallel Processing** - Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent analysis
4. **Selective LLM** - Apply criteria to determine OpenAI calls
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful failure with partial results
6. **Statistics** - Track efficiency metrics

### Error Handling & Retry Logic
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Partial failure handling
- Graceful degradation to sequential processing
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Game Analysis with Batch Processing
```python
from backend.game_analyzer import GameAnalyzer

analyzer = GameAnalyzer()

# Analyze entire game with batch processing
analyzed_moments = analyzer.analyze_game_moments(
    moments=game_moments,
    depth=15,
    user_rating=1650,
    user_level="intermediate"
)

# Results include efficiency statistics
print(f"LLM calls saved: {analyzer.get_efficiency_stats()}")
```

### Manual Batch Processing
```python
from backend.utils.batch_processor import BatchProcessor

processor = BatchProcessor("http://ai-engine:5000")

# Process large batch with automatic chunking
results = processor.process_large_batch(
    positions=large_position_list,
    max_batch_size=50,
    default_depth=20,
    selective_llm=True
)
```

### Database Batch Operations
```python
from backend.utils.db_batch import DatabaseBatchOperations

db_ops = DatabaseBatchOperations(supabase_client)

# Efficiently insert multiple game analyses
success = db_ops.batch_insert_game_analyses(
    analyses=game_analysis_records,
    batch_size=100
)
```

## 🧪 Testing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# AI Engine Configuration
STOCKFISH_POOL_SIZE=4          # Number of Stockfish instances
STOCKFISH_THREADS=2            # Threads per Stockfish instance
STOCKFISH_HASH=256            # Hash size in MB
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key       # OpenAI API key

# Batch Processing
MAX_BATCH_SIZE=50             # Maximum positions per batch
BATCH_TIMEOUT=300             # Timeout in seconds
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3              # Number of retry attempts
```

### Tuning Recommendations:
